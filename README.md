Blue Notes

These are the HTML, CSS and image files for the Blue Note album sleeves featured on my site stevehoneyman.co.uk/blue-notes - please feel free to download, play with and incorporate the code and ideas contained in these - I'd love to see what people might come up with! 

A word of warning, these are my working files, uploaded quickly for those who wanted to see them after a talk I did at WordUp Brighton late last month, the code has yet to be re-factored and could do with a tidy up, something I hope to have done soon.

The easiest way to view the sleeves is to download the repo and then go to the appropriate html file in each folder, for example; art-production.html or sidewinder-production.html It's not cool I know, but I'd recommend you use chrome to view the files, for the time being at least. I'll be updating the repo to include grid based layouts soon.
