Blue Notes

These are the HTML, CSS and image files for the Blue Note album sleeves featured on my site stevehoneyman.co.uk/blue-notes - please feel free to download, play with and incorporate the code and ideas contained in these - I'd love to see what people might come up with! 

The easiest way to view the sleeves is to download the repo and then go to the appropriate html file in each folder, for example; art-production.html or sidewinder-production.html. As an update I've started to work on CSS Grid layouts for the sleeves which can be found in the folder grid layouts.

It's not cool I know, but I'd recommend you use Chrome to view the older files and Firefox for grid files, for the time being at least.
