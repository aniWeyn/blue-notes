Blue Notes

These are the HTML, CSS and image files for the Blue Note album sleeves featured on my site stevehoneyman.co.uk/blue-notes - please feel free to download, play with and incorporate the code and ideas contained in these. 

A word of warning, these are my crude working files, uploaded quickly for those who wanted to see them after a talk at WordUp Brighton so the code is yet to be re-factored and could do with a tidy up, something I hope to have done by mid May. Additionally I'll be updating the repo to include grid based layouts soon.
